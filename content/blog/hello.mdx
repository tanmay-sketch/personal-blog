# Welcome to the first blog!

![Hero image for unstructured data](/blog/hello/hero.webp)

This is the first ever blog post on the unstructured blog. Why the name unstructured? 

**Unstructured** comes from the lack of structure in real data. I know it can sound like a buzzword, but it's true.

All of modern AI, Machine Learning, LLMs, and Data Science wouldn't exist without the structured data used to gain insights 
and build models. Structuring data itself is a complex task because of the nature of real data. All of the data around us is 
largely messy, unstructured, and unorganized. 

Somehow we need to take this messy gibberish and make sense of it. Now we use this organized data and our learnings 
to predict stuff, automate stuff, and build models. 

Fundamentally, there are only three types of operations you can do on data:
1. Store it
2. Retrieve it
3. Organize it

With these operations, we build models, develop insights, automate tasks, and do a bunch of other cool stuff. 

My hope with this blog is to share my journey of learning in the fields of AI, Machine Learning, and Data to strengthen my understanding
of concepts and give you an opportunity to learn something new along with me. 

Together, let's learn everything about the things built using data (ML, AI, Data Science, etc.) and things for data (Data Engineering, Data Architecture, etc.).

With that, feel free to check out other blogs, and let's get started!
